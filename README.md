## Recipes

### Change `duration` and/or `initialRemainingTime` once component is mounted

Once the component is mounted `duration` and `initialRemainingTime` can not be changed to avoid any issues computing colors and progress. To set new values for any of the two props just pass a new `key` prop to `CountdownCircleTimer` component and the timer will start over with the new values provided.

### Restart/Reset timer at any given time

Pass a `key` prop to `CountdownCircleTimer` and change the `key` when the timer should be restarted. Check [this demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/tender-bogdan-qd35m) to find out one possible implementation.

### Repeat timer when countdown is completed

Return an array from `onComplete` handler, which indicates if the animation should be repeated. Example:

```jsx
const UrgeWithPleasureComponent = () => (
  <CountdownCircleTimer
    onComplete={() => {
      // do your stuff here
      return [true, 1500] // repeat animation in 1.5 seconds
    }}
    isPlaying
    duration={10}
    colors="#A30000"
  />
)
```

### Set the initial remaining time different then the duration provided

Pass the remaining time to `initialRemainingTime` prop. Example:

```jsx
const UrgeWithPleasureComponent = () => (
  <CountdownCircleTimer
    isPlaying
    duration={60}
    initialRemainingTime={15}
    colors="#A30000"
  />
)
```

In the example above, the countdown will start at 15 seconds (one quarter before it's done) and it will animate for 15 seconds until reaches 0.

### Time formatting functions

`children` prop of `CountdownCircleTimer` component will receive as a prop `remainingTime` in seconds. Below are few function that can be used to get different time formatting:

- Format `mm:ss` (minutes and seconds)

```js
const children = ({ remainingTime }) => {
  const minutes = Math.floor(remainingTime / 60)
  const seconds = remainingTime % 60

  return `${minutes}:${seconds}`
}
```

- Format `hh:mm:ss` (hours, minutes and seconds)

```js
const children = ({ remainingTime }) => {
  const hours = Math.floor(remainingTime / 3600)
  const minutes = Math.floor((remainingTime % 3600) / 60)
  const seconds = remainingTime % 60

  return `${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`
}
```
